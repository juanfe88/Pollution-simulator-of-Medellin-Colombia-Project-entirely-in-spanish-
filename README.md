# Pollution-simulator-of-Medellin-Colombia-Project-entirely-in-spanish-
A functional static simulation app powered by R and shiny
All of the information for the development of the model was obtained from the official data site of Medellin's metropolitan area.

The model conception and part of the ETL and the EDA are on the "Simulacion.R" script. Nevertheless, since I did part of the ETL directly on the console, 
for some data there's just the loading of the RData file.
